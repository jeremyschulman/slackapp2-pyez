# Python3 toolkit for building Slack apps

The slackapptk package was created to facilitate the development of Slack
applications using Python3 and your choice of web frameworks.

slackapptk uses the packages provided by the Slack community:
   * [slackclient](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient)
   * [python-slack-events-api](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api) 

The slackapptk package is not specific to any Python web framework (Flask,
Django, FastAPI, etc.). As a Slack app developer you can choose your web
framework, create your app-specific-logic, and take advantage of slackapptk to
do much of the drudgery associated with _routing_ the api.slack.com messages to
the "right code" in your application.
